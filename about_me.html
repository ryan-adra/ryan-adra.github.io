          <h1>Hello World. I'm Ryan Adra.</h1>
          <p>I'm currently a 4th year Computer Science major attending University of California, Irvine, specializing in Information. 
            I am based in Los Angeles, which is where I've been raised for most of my life after moving from the Philippines to the United States at a young age.
            I have been interested in a person's experience with technology for a while when I would question to myself why people behave in certain ways when given
            new features or new interfaces for their products, but I did not know there was a field of study dedicated to that until I got into college.  
            College was also when I realized my growing interest in designing user interfaces for websites and mobile apps rather than developing software, and because of
            my internship in a product management team, I also liked working on user research and growing a product. From my experiences, I decided to pursue a career in UX/Product Design. 
            I'm still growing as a designer myself, but I aspire to be a UX designer who creates accessible and inclusive user experiences in order to have more users enjoy the products they use on the daily.
            <br><br><strong>Ultimately, I want to use technology to create social good and to help people all around, whether it be my local communities or ones I'm a part of or people
            all over the world.</strong><br><br> If I'm not working on new designs or new side projects, you will catch me binge watching a lot of anime/kdramas,
            tweeting into the existence, eating a lot of good food, or travelling (pre-COVID of course).<br><br>
