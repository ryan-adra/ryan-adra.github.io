        <p>Today was the first day of Google CSSI, and I'm already amazed by everything.
          The tour of the Google office made me fall in love with the complex. The HTML
          and CSS we learned blew my mind. The people were some of the most interesting and
          motivated people I have ever met. It was an experience.

        <p>Today we went on a great adventure. We ate at a local favorite In n Out.
          We satisfied our sweet tooths with some Diddy Riese's ice cream. We ended
          our fun day with a trip to an escape room.
