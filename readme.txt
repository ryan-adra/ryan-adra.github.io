1.  The number of assignment points I believe I have completed is at least 9 points. 
    I would say I may miss a point either in responsiveness or validity for accessibility.
    My responsiveness can be better since I know that my content may go from looking tiny to 
    being big again afer reaching a certain px screen width, which may cause a problem, but
    I am not too sure about that. I also checked my website with the accessibility checker
    and have tried to fix some problems, but I know I have some other problems I could easily
    resolve if I use clearer text or use other types of tags.
2.  HTML content: at least one image with descriptive alt attribute(s), 
    appropriate headings and paragraph text, links to external page(s), multiple pages,
    with appropriate navigation between them, adding custom icons from Font Awesome.
    CSS content: modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability,
    modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, adding custom font(s)
    from Google fonts to add more personality.
    Advanced feature(s): having a navigation bar, leveraging nested selectors to specify format
3.  This took me about 3-4 days in total to complete the assignment.
4.  I mainly used w3schools.com to find tutorials on how to implement certain CSS features.
5.  I didn't really consult classmates, but I looked at other peoples' portfolios online to gain
    some design inspiration for my own portfolio.
